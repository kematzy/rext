= Rext

Rext is primarily used for the Evolution CMS project, and its dependencies,
however it is de-coupled and free to use within your own project.

== Motivations

* ActiveSupport does not contain everything we need, and is messy IMO
* Very easy to cherry-pick what you need
* Provide better documentation
* Attention to quality and performance
* Abstraction of loosely coupled helpers used throughout Evolution and its sub-gems

== Usage

  require 'rext/all'

  # or 

  require 'rext/string'
  require 'rext/hash'
  ...

  # or 

  require 'rext/string/escape'
  require 'rext/enumerable/every'
  ...
